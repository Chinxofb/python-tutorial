#python has not command for declaring 
#a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it
x = 5
y = "Yellow"
print(x)
print(y)
#variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
#you need to have a worded variable inbetween double or singhle quotes
print(x)
#variable names are case-sensitive
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
print(x)
print (y)
print (z)
#you can get the type of a variable with the type() function
